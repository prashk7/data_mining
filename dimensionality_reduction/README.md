# Dimensionality reduction

You are given two datasets, each containing a data table of 1000 vector with 100 attributes (i.e., dimensions) in two files with 500 samples for each file. Each dataset is given by two tables of 500 samples each. Both datasets are given as text table files where each dataset is represented as a 1000 x 100 matrix where each row of the matrix is a vector. You are further told that for each dataset, for all the samples (i.e., vectors) the component values of each vector follow the same distribution. For all the datasets, the only possible distributions are either Gaussian or uniform.

The datasets given are dist1_500_1.txt, dist1_500_2.txt and dist2_500_1.txt, dist2_500_2.txt\

### Determined the distributions of the vector component values for both datasets. For each dataset, randomly picked up 10 samples and reported the distribution parameters for each of the 10 samples.

### Implemented PCA on both the Data sets and observerd the result.

### Implemented DCT on both the Data sets and observed the result.
